/**
 * ## Structure
 *
 * If the following JSON were mapped to a variable `{json::*}`
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "foo": 15,
 *   "bar": "test",
 *   "baz": {
 *     "foobar": [
 *       {
 *         "quux": false
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * the following assertions would be true:
 *
 * ```
 * {json::foo} is 15
 * {json::bar} is "test"
 * {json::baz} is true                    # special case
 * {json::baz::foobar} is true            # special case
 * {json::baz::foobar::1} is true         # special case
 * {json::baz::foobar::1::quux} is false
 * ```
 *
 * The variables marked `# special case` contain nested JSON objects and are true so Skript can
 * properly loop through the variable. These variables (like `{json::baz}`, not list variables like
 * `{json::baz::*}`) can be deleted and the structure will still properly serialize into JSON.
